== Problem Characterization
Stations where bikes are docked and taken from are a common way of implementing a bike sharing system. However, 
Our goal is to adapt pricing for different routes to increase the efficiency of the system by incentivizing bike usage from stations with a high number of bikes to a low number of bikes.

The system dynamics can be formulated as follows:
- $b_s(t)$ : the number of bikes at station $s ∈ ℕ$ at time $t$
- $d_s(t)$ : the demand of taking a bike at time $t$ at station s
- $$
