abstract = {This paper aimed to address the need for a comprehensive review on the factors affecting bike-sharing demand to bridge the gaps by deepening the knowledge on weather, built environment and land use, public transportation, station level, socio-demographic effects, temporal factors, and safety. This article evaluates recent studies on station-based bike sharing in literature and seeks answers to two main research questions: First, how do the weather conditions, built environment and land use, public transportation, socio-demographic attributes, temporal factors, and safety affect the bike-sharing trip demand? Second, what are the most commonly used factors in literature affecting trip demand? For this purpose, an overview of the factors affecting trip demands has been established to evaluate the performance of Bike-Share Programs(BSPs) comprehensively. The results can provide reliable estimate for planners or decision-makers in understanding the key factors contributing to bike-sharing demand. The information obtained from this overview can also be a guideline for BSP planners, policymakers and researchers to improve the efficiency of BSPs.}
