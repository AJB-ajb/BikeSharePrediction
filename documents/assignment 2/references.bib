They provide a low-cost, environmentally-friendly transportation alternative for cities. The management of these systems gives rise to many optimization problems. Chief among these problems is the issue of bicycle rebalancing. Users imbalance the system by creating demand in an asymmetric pattern. This necessitates action to put the system back in balance with the requisite levels of bicycles at each station to facilitate future use. In this paper, we tackle the problem of maintaing system balance during peak rush-hour usageas well as rebalancing overnight to prepare the systemfor rush-hour usage. We provide novel problem formulationsthat have been motivated by both a close collaborationwith the New York City bike share (Citibike) and a careful analysisof system usage data. We analyze system data to discover the best placement of bikes tofacilitate usage. We solve routing problems forovernight shifts as well as clustering problems for handlingmid rush-hour usage.

abstract = {As an emerging mobility service, bike-sharing has become increasingly popular around the world. A critical question in planning and designing bike-sharing services is to know how different factors, such as land-use and built environment, affect bike-sharing demand. Most research investigated this problem from a holistic view using regression models, where assume the factor coefficients are spatially homogeneous. However, ignoring the local spatial effects of different factors is not tally with facts. Therefore, we develop a regression model with spatially varying coefficients to investigate how land use, social-demographic, and transportation infrastructure affect the bike-sharing demand at different stations to address this problem. Unlike existing geographically weighted models, we define station-specific regression and use a graph structure to encourage nearby stations to have similar coefficients. Using the bike-sharing data from the BIXI service in Montreal, we showcase the spatially varying patterns in the regression coefficients and highlight more sensitive areas to the marginal change of a specific factor. The proposed model also exhibits superior out-of-sample prediction power compared with traditional machine learning models and geostatistical models.}

This article evaluates recent studies on station-based bike sharing in literature and seeks answers to two main research questions: First, how do the weather conditions, built environment and land use, public transportation, socio-demographic attributes, temporal factors, and safety affect the bike-sharing trip demand? Second, what are the most commonly used factors in literature affecting trip demand? For this purpose, an overview of the factors affecting trip demands has been established to evaluate the performance of Bike-Share Programs(BSPs) comprehensively. The results can provide reliable estimate for planners or decision-makers in understanding the key factors contributing to bike-sharing demand. The information obtained from this overview can also be a guideline for BSP planners, policymakers and researchers to improve the efficiency of BSPs.}

ABSTRACT = {An important question in planning and designing bike-sharing services is to support the user’s travel demand by allocating bikes at the stations in an efficient and reliable manner which may require accurate short-time demand prediction. This study focuses on the short-term forecasting, 15 min ahead, of the shared bikes demand in Montreal using a deep learning approach. Having a set of bike trips, the study first identifies 6 communities in the bike-sharing network using the Louvain algorithm. Then, four groups of LSTM-based architectures are adopted to predict pickup demand in each community. A univariate ARIMA model is also used to compare results as a benchmark. The historical trip data from 2017 to 2021 are used in addition to the extra inputs of demand related engineered features, weather conditions, and temporal variables. The selected timespan allows predicting bike demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that the deep learning models significantly outperform the ARIMA one. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest prediction accuracy. Furthermore, adding the extra variables improves the model performance regardless of its architecture. Thus, using the hybrid structure enriched with additional input features provides a better insight into the bike demand patterns, in support of bike-sharing operational management.},

abstract = {Short-term demand prediction is important for managing transportation infrastructure, particularly in times of disruption, or around new developments. Many bike-sharing schemes face the challenges of managing service provision and bike fleet rebalancing due to the “tidal flows” of travel and use. For them, it is crucial to have precise predictions of travel demand at a fine spatiotemporal granularities. Despite recent advances in machine learning approaches (e.g. deep neural networks) and in short-term traffic demand predictions, relatively few studies have examined this issue using a feature engineering approach to inform model selection. This research extracts novel time-lagged variables describing graph structures and flow interactions from real-world bike usage datasets, including graph node Out-strength, In-strength, Out-degree, In-degree and PageRank. These are used as inputs to different machine learning algorithms to predict short-term bike demand. The results of the experiments indicate the graph-based attributes to be more important in demand prediction than more commonly used meteorological information. The results from the different machine learning approaches (XGBoost, MLP, LSTM) improve when time-lagged graph information is included. Deep neural networks were found to be better able to handle the sequences of the time-lagged graph variables than other approaches, resulting in more accurate forecasting. Thus incorporating graph-based features can improve understanding and modelling of demand patterns in urban areas, supporting bike-sharing schemes and promoting sustainable transport. The proposed approach can be extended into many existing models using spatial data and can be readily transferred to other applications for predicting dynamics in mass transit systems. A number of limitations and areas of further work are discussed.}
