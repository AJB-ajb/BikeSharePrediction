They provide a low-cost, environmentally-friendly transportation alternative for cities. The management of these systems gives rise to many optimization problems. Chief among these problems is the issue of bicycle rebalancing. Users imbalance the system by creating demand in an asymmetric pattern. This necessitates action to put the system back in balance with the requisite levels of bicycles at each station to facilitate future use. In this paper, we tackle the problem of maintaing system balance during peak rush-hour usageas well as rebalancing overnight to prepare the systemfor rush-hour usage. We provide novel problem formulationsthat have been motivated by both a close collaborationwith the New York City bike share (Citibike) and a careful analysisof system usage data. We analyze system data to discover the best placement of bikes tofacilitate usage. We solve routing problems forovernight shifts as well as clustering problems for handlingmid rush-hour usage. The tools developed from this research are currently in daily use at NYC Bike Share LLC, operators of Citibike. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={O’Mahony, Eoin and Shmoys, David}, year={2015}, month={Feb.} }

abstract = {As an emerging mobility service, bike-sharing has become increasingly popular around the world. A critical question in planning and designing bike-sharing services is to know how different factors, such as land-use and built environment, affect bike-sharing demand. Most research investigated this problem from a holistic view using regression models, where assume the factor coefficients are spatially homogeneous. However, ignoring the local spatial effects of different factors is not tally with facts. Therefore, we develop a regression model with spatially varying coefficients to investigate how land use, social-demographic, and transportation infrastructure affect the bike-sharing demand at different stations to address this problem. Unlike existing geographically weighted models, we define station-specific regression and use a graph structure to encourage nearby stations to have similar coefficients. Using the bike-sharing data from the BIXI service in Montreal, we showcase the spatially varying patterns in the regression coefficients and highlight more sensitive areas to the marginal change of a specific factor. The proposed model also exhibits superior out-of-sample prediction power compared with traditional machine learning models and geostatistical models.}

abstract = {This paper aimed to address the need for a comprehensive review on the factors affecting bike-sharing demand to bridge the gaps by deepening the knowledge on weather, built environment and land use, public transportation, station level, socio-demographic effects, temporal factors, and safety. This article evaluates recent studies on station-based bike sharing in literature and seeks answers to two main research questions: First, how do the weather conditions, built environment and land use, public transportation, socio-demographic attributes, temporal factors, and safety affect the bike-sharing trip demand? Second, what are the most commonly used factors in literature affecting trip demand? For this purpose, an overview of the factors affecting trip demands has been established to evaluate the performance of Bike-Share Programs(BSPs) comprehensively. The results can provide reliable estimate for planners or decision-makers in understanding the key factors contributing to bike-sharing demand. The information obtained from this overview can also be a guideline for BSP planners, policymakers and researchers to improve the efficiency of BSPs.}
